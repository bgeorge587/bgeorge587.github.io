If you are currently in love with the planet Venus, either in the sky or in your chart, your capacity for love is growing. It can be love for people, for being alive, or for yourself. Believe it or not, this capacity to love yourself grows when you indulge, as the goddess Venus might, in beautiful surroundings and clothes, art, music, baths and other beauty rituals such as makeovers, and glasses of wine. It’s true: Only when you treat yourself like a beloved can you have real love for others.</p><img src= 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/10/nasa-venus-759.jpg' width='50%' height='50%'>";

				html2 = "<h1>Mars</h1><p>People fond of Mars can back and greatly admire their many accomplishments and enchanted by the prospect of a future brimming with more. Enjoy how competition and deadlines inspire you to be your best and to seize awards or more money or power, or simply feel like a winner in the game of life. If you love Mars right now does that mean you’re in the mood to fight and argue? No, except in self-defense. But you might be rather full of yourself.</p><img src= 'https://mars.nasa.gov/system/site_config_values/meta_share_images/1_mars-nasa-gov.jpg' width='50%' height='50%'>";

				html3 = "<h1>Jupiter</h1><p>King of the gods, planet of benevolence and good fortune, Jupiter gives you the impulse to give back or pay it forward. When you love Jupiter you’ll have more guests, host the holidays, maybe even invite relatives to live with you, and donate more to your favorite causes. You are also an easy touch for beggars or borrowers; they can sense Jupiter’s generous aura from yards away. Love for Jupiter also encourages savings and restructuring of personal finances. There’s no such thing as a king or queen who lives from paycheck to paycheck.</p><img src='http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/hs-2016-24-a-print-new.jpg' width='50%' height='50%'>";

				html4 = "<h1>Saturn</h1><p>Some people fear this planet’s influence, yet Saturn’s rings make it the most gorgeous planet, and love is the antidote to fear. Being drawn to this planet signifies willingness to do your best on projects important to you, those you want to be remembered for: writing a book, raising great kids, professional achievements, looking amazing, running for political office. Although you’re prepared to soldier through, self-care is a must during this time. Take special care of extremities, nails and bones and dress well. Be as beautiful and deliberate as Saturn.</p><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Saturn_during_Equinox.jpg' width='60%' height='50%'>";

			function button5() {
				html5 = "<h1>Neptune</h1><p>If this beautiful blue planet is your current favorite, beliefs and spirituality are priorities and you’re ready to master arts such as prayer, meditation, and relaxation. Besides astral travel, travel to beaches, lakes, spas and islands where you can revel in the miracle of the many forms of water. If there are no such opportunities you can, amazingly, create them. Expect a sudden interest in a new type of music. At this time too you might be at your most effective as a counselor or caregiver. Neptune is comfort, selfless love, and inspiration.</p><img src='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/system/feature_items/images/82_carousel_neptune_1.jpg' width='50%' height='50%'>";

			function button6() {
				html6 = "<h1>Uranus</h1><p>Yes, try on a whole new life: become political, become a homebody, take a job that’s above your skill set and master it. You’ll learn how intelligent you are and also how to listen to your intelligent body when it’s hungry or tired, because eager Uranus tempts you not to care about basics such as your health. You’re the bright light at parties and in crowds, discovering farther reaches of your powers of attraction and charisma. Often, a liking for this planet means you’re ready for a fling, or several flings.</p><img src='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/system/feature_items/images/89_uranus_carousel_1.jpg' width='50%' height='50%'>";

			function button7() {
				html7 = "<h1>Pluto</h1><p>A certain kind of lifestyle is over. It’s time to move out or get serious, turn away from mourning, dump the unsupportive people in your life, reveal the truth, or finally decide to be yourself. Traveling this path you’ll find like-minded others who can become your next set of friends if you force yourself to communicate and keep in touch. They’ll help lift you out of your old life so you’ll never have to live through that again.</p><img src='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/internal_resources/1157' width='50%' height='50%'>";

			function button8() {
				html8 = "<h1>Mercury</h1><p> Your mind is like a student’s: quick, sharp, scheduled, and detailed-oriented. You are the one who sure to ace anything and perform miracles. During the time that Mercury is your favorite planet you will de-clutter your space, buy new electronics, toss old kitchen gear and towels and buy updated ones, and redistribute your time so work doesn’t overwhelm the rest of your life and your personal life doesn’t overwhelm your work.</p><img src='https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/mercury_1.jpg' width='50%' height='50%'>";
